                Tech Talk is a small initiative taken by the students of UIT-RGPV to spread technology 
                awareness among the students. We believe it is us the youth which can take technology awareness to the next level. 
                We always come across people or seller who force their ideas 
                related to technology like saying AMD and Intel are the same. 
                We want to make you independent so that when you go to buy new products its always easy for you to select the product. 
                We want to make you aware of the latest technology. We want you to show off your tech knowledge to everyone you meet. 
                We want you to promote technology.  
                Unlike other tech clubs we are unified community talking about the latest and the greatest of all the big tech giants as well as 
                about tech startups.
