             "Technology is a gift of God. After the gift of life it is perhaps the greatest of God's gifts. It is the mother of civilizations, 
                    of arts and of sciences."

               Tech Talk is an initiative by the students of UIT-RGPV to spread awareness about technology among the student community. 
               We believe it is us, the youth, who can take awareness about technology to the next level. 
               We always come across people or sellers who force their ideas or knowledge about technology upon us, like saying AMD and Intel are the same(Which are not). 
               Through our initiative we want to make you independent so that when you go to buy new products its easy for you to judge and select the right product without any influence of anyone. We want to make you aware of the latest technology. We want you to boast your tech knowledge to everyone you meet, also we want you to promote and spread tech knowledge among the public. 
               Tech Talk is a unified community talking about the latest and the greatest of all the big tech giants in 
               the world of computer technology. We also talk about startups in this field.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">
            We as a team of geeks keep ourselves updated with the latest technology and promote it. 
            We go to various institutions to spread all tech knowledge we gather through rigorous research and exhaustive readings. 
            When we stand on the podium to talk about technology, we tell every small bit of it and that too in a interactive way 
            so that students can grasp it easily. We are driven by the urge to keep India updated. India is getting digital, so should we. 
            At the end of our seminars, students gain enough knowledge about the topics  that were discussed. 
            They are stand out of the crowd as they have better knowledge about technology than others. 
            We also try to give hands-on experience of any one technology that we cover in our seminars, 
            like we organised ARA-Hunt to give a hands-on experience of Google X's Project ARA, in one of our seminars.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">
            Finally, we would like to say, "change begins from us. It is our job to spread knowledge. 
            We are trying, so should you to make India digital."
